# Description

This eLearning platform allows users to log in as a student, mentor, or admin. Students can browse and enroll in courses, while mentors can manage their courses. Admins have full CRUD capabilities for users and courses and must approve student and mentor accounts before they can log in. The app features pagination, filtering, and sorting for course management. Configuration requires setting MongoDB credentials and running a seed script to populate dummy data. The platform is designed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly online learning experience.
